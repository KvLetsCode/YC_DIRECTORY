## 🛠 How I Built It

* **Component-based React architecture**

  * `StartupCard` for individual startup entries
  * `SearchBar` for live search
  * `FilterControls` for industry/stage filtering
  * `Directory` for rendering the grid

* **UI & Styling**

  * TailwindCSS for responsive layouts
  * ShadCnUI for quick styling and consistent design

* **Interactivity**

  * Implemented manual navigation and filtering logic in React
  * Added state management with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

* **Performance**

  * Used **Vite** for lightning-fast dev/build setup
  * Optimized rendering with conditional maps and filtered lists

* **Deployment**

  * Hosted on **GitHub Pages** for free and accessible live demo
